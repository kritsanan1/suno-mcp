## Prompt Engineering Tips

### Specificity Matters
- **Vague**: "synthwave song"
- **Better**: "80s inspired synthwave with female vocals"
- **Best**: "dreamy synthwave ballad with Japanese female vocals, analog synthesizers, gated reverb drums"

### Musical Elements
- **Instrumentation**: Specify instruments and timbres
- **Style references**: "Juno-106 style", "analog warmth"
- **Production techniques**: "gated reverb", "tape saturation"
- **Emotional qualities**: "ethereal", "mysterious", "driving"

### Contextual Details
- **Setting**: "futuristic Vienna", "neon city", "cyberpunk"
- **Mood**: "dreamy", "atmospheric", "energetic"
- **Era**: "80s inspired", "retro", "nostalgic"

### Iteration Strategy
1. **Start broad**: Basic genre and mood
2. **Add details**: Specific instruments and techniques
3. **Refine**: Adjust based on results
4. **Layer**: Build complex arrangements step by step

## Claude Desktop Integration Examples

### Basic Generation
```
Use the suno_generate_track tool to create: "dreamy synthwave with Japanese vocals about futuristic Vienna"
```

### Studio Workflow
```
1. suno_studio_create_project with name "Vienna Synthwave"
2. suno_studio_generate_stem for vocals: "ethereal Japanese female vocals"
3. suno_studio_generate_stem for drums: "80s gated reverb beats"
4. suno_studio_generate_stem for bass: "deep analog synth bass"
5. suno_studio_arrange_track to position stems on timeline
6. suno_studio_export_project as final mix
```

### Iterative Refinement
```
Generate initial track, then use suno_studio_generate_stem to add specific elements:
- Replace drums with more atmospheric version
- Add guitar solo in bridge section
- Adjust vocal delivery to be more emotional
- Fine-tune mix levels and effects
```

## Best Practices

### Start Simple
Begin with basic prompts and gradually add complexity as you learn what works.

### Document Successes
Keep track of prompts that produce great results for future reference.

### Iterate Gradually
Make small changes rather than complete rewrites when refining tracks.

### Combine Manual + AI
Use Suno for generation, then traditional DAW tools for final polishing.

### Experiment Fearlessly
Synthwave is forgiving - try wild combinations and see what emerges!
